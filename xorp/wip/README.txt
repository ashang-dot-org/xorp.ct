So, I tried to remove most of the Exception logic since
Fedora-26 compiler warns throw() signatures are invalid.

Wasted a week or two of my life it seems, because the patches
are all tangled and I introduced bugs.

So, I'm adding the patches here in disgust, in case I decide to
try again some day.  Anyone wants a project and maybe some pay,
let me know.
